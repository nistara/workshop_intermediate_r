Debugging
=========

This chapter is part 2 (of 2) of _Thinking in R_, a workshop series about how R
works and how to examine code critically. The major topics of this chapter are
how R prints output, how R's conditions system for warnings and errors works,
how to use the R debugger, and how to estimate the performance of R code.

#### Learning Objectives {-}

* Identify and explain the difference between R's various printing functions
* Use R's conditions system to raise and catch messages, warnings, and errors
* Use R's debugging functions to diagnose bugs in code
* Estimate the amount of memory a data set will require
* Use the lobstr package to get memory usage for an R object
* Describe what a profiler is and why you would use one
* Describe what kinds of profiling tools R provides
