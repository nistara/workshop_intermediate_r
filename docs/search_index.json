[["index.html", "Intermediate R Overview", " Intermediate R Nick Ulle 2022-06-23 Overview This 5-part workshop series (in which the 5th workshop is an optional online Q&amp;A) aims to help learners understand the relatively small but fundamental computational model underlying the R language. This will help you reason about code before you write and run it, and to debug it if it doesn’t do what you want. A sound understanding of this computational model makes programming in R much easier and more productive! After this workshop series learners should be able to: Define “REPL” Interpret error messages Navigate the global environment Explain data type hierarchy Evaluate the consequences of implicit coercion Describe how function calls work Define scoping rules Distinguish between S3 and S4 Write a function Plan an approach for debugging code Increase your productivity and confidence in using R Identify where to go to learn more! Another title for this workshop could be “Everything You Should Have Learned About R.” These workshops are not an introduction to R. Participants are expected to have prior experience using R, be comfortable with basic R syntax, and to have it pre-installed and running on their laptops. This series is appropriate for motivated intermediate to advanced users who want a better understanding of base R.
